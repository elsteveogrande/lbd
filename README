LBD

LBD stands for Layered Block Device; this project is a server for such
devices.  It aims to behave like an NBD (network block device) server such as
the one the "nbd" project provides, and aims to be compatible with the client
that is part of the Linux kernel.

LBD devices behave like physical ones, in that they contain a sequence of
blocks that may be read or written, but with additional logic happening
transparently underneath.

Whereas a traditional block device (usually a hard disk, but could be
something more virtual like an iSCSI target) simply stores or retrieves 
sectors to/from a platter (or flash memory, or the iSCSI server), an LBD-
type device stores to an NBD server.

This LBD server can be as simple as a plain old block server, or can contain
several layers to which reads and writes are assigned.  Layers are stackable.

Consider the following example:

layer 2   [writable sparse "change" file]
layer 1   [readonly base flat file]
layer 0   [readonly "null" layer]

Let layer 1 be a readonly, static snapshot taken at some point in time.
(This can be a physical device like /dev/sdb2, or a special file.)

Layer 2 is a writable file that contains changes made to the volume.
Initially, layer 2 is empty; any reads from the device return data from
layer 1.  As writes are done to the device, the new blocks are stored in
this change file; subsequent reads at these blocks' addresses will return
the modified data.

(Layer 0 is a sentinel which is not writable but always readable, and reads
from this layer always result in 0x00 bytes being written.)

So this model can represent a device backed by static content (perhaps an
"image" of a filesystem containing files for a database) that is modifiable
locally.  More usefully, this backing image can be exported to multiple
machines, each with their own local changefiles, so that no hosts share each
others' changes.  More usefully yet, these instances can be built very quickly
so a replica of a filesystem (database instance) can be stood up in a very
short time.


Data Sources Supported

FlatFile        A simple format containing a sequence of 512-byte blocks.

ExpandableFile  A "sparse" file that contains just modified sectors.  This
                layer intercepts changes to the device, storing them to this
                file.  Sectors not previously written here fail and are thus
                reads to these "holes" are delegated to lower layers.

NBD             Connects to another NBD server over TCP.  Can be any 
                compatible NBD server such as the "nbd" project's server, or
                another LBD instance (since every LBD instance serves over
                NBD).

NullLayer       Not really a datasource you would add yourself; it's
                transparently always added to the bottom of the LBD device's
                stack of layers.  Reads are always successful and result in
                ASCII 0x00 bytes.  Writes are never successful (hopefully
                a write would be captured by a higher, writeable layer).


An LBD device can be made writable or read-only.


Example client setup:

# on Linux
apt-get install nbd-client   # debian-like
sudo yum install nbd         # fedora/redhat/centos like
sudo modprobe nbd
nbd-client 10.0.0.1 7777 /dev/nbd0

# on OSX: coming soon!  See osx-nbd project on github...
...


Example server invocation:

# vanilla block server; use a local (unmounted) hard disk
# can also use a special file in lieu of a physical device
CP=lib/java-getopt-1.0.13.jar
CP=bin:$CP
LBD="java -cp $CP cc.obrien.lbd.LBD"
$LBD -a6666 -l7777 -s 1G -E /tmp/test.expandable

# many machines using a common image from remote host,
# but save changes locally.
# First initialize 1GB ext3 volume.
dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/test.flatfile bs=1024 count=1048576
mkfs.ext3 /tmp/test.flatfile
mkdir /tmp/vol
mount -o loop /tmp/test.flatfile /tmp/vol
# Put some useful data in there
cp -rp /var/db /tmp/vol
umount /tmp/vol
# Export this on port 7777 on one machine.
$LBD -l7777 -s 1G -F /tmp/test.flatfile
# On another machine, use NBD to get at the flat file's contents,
# and capture any change to that volume's blocks locally.
$LBD -l9999 -s 1G -E /tmp/test.expandable -n masterhost:7777
# On this same host, mount this block device via loopback
nbd-client localhost 9999 /dev/nbd0


Invocation

general options:
    -h                this help
    -b blockcount     (-b or -s required) the size of the virtual device,
                      in blocks (1 block = 512 bytes)
    -s bytecount      (-b or -s required) the size of the virtual device,
                      in bytes; can use suffix like K, M, G, T

server options:
    -l [ip:]port      the TCP ip/port to listen on for NBD clients
                      (optional; default is 0.0.0.0:7777)
    -a [ip:]port      the TCP ip/port to listen on for manager commands
                      (optional; default is localhost:6666)

to specify layers: (at least one is required)
    -e filename       readonly expandable file
    -E filename       writable expandable file
    -f filename       readonly flat file (file size must == device size)
    -F filename       writable flat file (file size must == device size)
    -n ip:port        readonly remote NBD device (read cache enabled)
    -N ip:port        writable remote NBD host (caching disabled)
    -X ip:port        writable remote NBD host w/ assumed exclusive access
                      (since exclusive access assumed, cache is enabled)


Management Daemon

The LBD process launches, in addition to the TCP listener for NBD block
serving, a manager daemon that listens on another port (default 6666).

Request types are:

PING            get a "true" response back; otherwise does nothing

SHUTDOWN        stop device gracefully and shutdown

DEVICE_INFO_STRINGS
                gets a bunch of informational config strings

LIVE_ADD_LAYER <filename>
                adds an expandable layer as the new top layer;
                this layer is writable.  Specify a file that lives on (or can
                be created on the server system.


Only the SHUTDOWN and LIVE_ADD_LAYER requests are supported by the included
command line interface.  Run with:

  java -cp (...) cc.obrien.lbd.manager.Control stop
  java -cp (...) cc.obrien.lbd.manager.Control add (filename)
